        <p>I began this assignment by creating a local web server on my ESP32 board that would turn an LED on and off. Next I wanted to redesign code to allow a firebase server that would be able to send inputs to the ESP32. This also reqired an html page that is linked to the "toggle" below. Lastly, I decided to add a servo connection to the board. This was a bit difficult because I had to add a library that would allow the board to accept arduino servo commands. Eventually I got it working and added a green light to alternate with the red one. I had an idea to place the entire board, with a portable battery, in a box that would lock with the servo, but I didn't get to finish that. The circuit itself works well.</p>
